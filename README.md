# Perfd opt

The previous [Project WIPE](https://github.com/yc9559/cpufreq-interactive-opt), automatically adjust the `interactive` parameters via simulation and heuristic optimization algorithms, and working on all mainstream devices which use `interactive` as default governor. The recent [WIPE v2](https://github.com/yc9559/wipe-v2), improved simulation supports more features of the kernel and focuses on rendering performance requirements, automatically adjusting the `interactive`+`HMP`+`input boost` parameters. However, after the EAS is merged into the mainline, the simulation difficulty of auto-tuning depends on raise. It is difficult to simulate the logic of the EAS scheduler. In addition, EAS is designed to avoid parameterization at the beginning of design, so for example, the adjustment of schedutil has no obvious effect.  

[WIPE v2](https://github.com/yc9559/wipe-v2) focuses on meeting performance requirements when interacting with APP, while reducing non-interactive lag weights, pushing the trade-off between fluency and power saving even further. `QTI Boost Framework`, which must be disabled before applying optimization, is able to dynamically override parameters based on perf hint. This project utilizes `QTI Boost Framework` and extends the ability of override custom parameters. When launching APPs or scrolling the screen, applying more aggressive parameters to improve response at an acceptable power penalty. When there is no interaction, use conservative parameters, use small core clusters as much as possible, and run at a higher energy efficiency OPP under heavy load.

## Profiles

- powersave: based on balance mode, but with lower max frequency
- balance: smoother than the stock config with lower power consumption
- performance: dynamic stune boost = 30 with no frequency limitation
- fast: providing stable performance capacity considering the TDP limitation of device chassis
